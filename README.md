- 👋 Hi, I’m @lizferraro!
- 🌱 I have experience in developing websites using Wordpress, basic HTML, and basic CSS, and I am currently studying to become a fullstack developer with a focus on Mongo DB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. 
- 🤓 As a lifelong learner, I look forward to later expanding into additional languages and tools! I am interested in building dynamic websites, software solutions, mobile applications, and maybe even a game or two. 
- 🌍 Feel free to reach out at elizabeth.k.ferraro@gmail.com.
