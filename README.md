- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lizferraro! Thanks for taking the time to look me up!
- ðŸŒ± I have experience in developing websites using Wordpress, basic HTML, and basic CSS, and I am currently studying to become a fullstack developer with a focus on Mongo DB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. 
- ðŸ¤“ As a lifelong learner, I look forward to later expanding into additional languages and tools! I am interested in building dynamic websites, software solutions, mobile applications, and maybe even a game or two. 
- Thanks again for stopping by. If you're interested to see what I'm up to, check me out on lizferraro.github.io or feel free to reach out at elizabeth.k.ferraro@gmail.com.
